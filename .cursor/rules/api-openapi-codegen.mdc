description: Generate and use typed API clients from OpenAPI

# API Codegen Rules â€” OpenAPI

- Treat `[openapi.yaml](mdc:docs-cursor/api/openapi.yaml)` as source of truth; update before coding
- Generate TS types/clients (e.g., `openapi-typescript`, `orval`) and use in Next.js `api-client`
- Responses use `{ data, meta }` for lists; include standard error responses
- Support pagination (`page`, `pageSize`) and sorting via query params
- Keep examples in OpenAPI for complex endpoints
- Reference: `[Tech Stack](mdc:docs-cursor/tech-stack.md)`
