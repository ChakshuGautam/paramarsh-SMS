# RBAC/ABAC Rules

- Roles: student, parent, teacher, homeroom_teacher, hod, admin, finance, hr, transport_manager, librarian, nurse, counselor, discipline_officer, super_admin
- Always scope queries by `tenantId` (orgId)
- Use `ACGuard` + `AclValidateRequestInterceptor` (create/update) + `AclFilterResponseInterceptor` (read)
- Compute ABAC constraints in services (e.g., taughtSectionIds); apply to `where`
- Standardize denials (403) with Error schema; audit decisions
- Reference: `[RBAC/ABAC Design](mdc:docs-cursor/security/rbac.md)`
