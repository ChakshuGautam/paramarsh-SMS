# Code Style

- Prefer clear, descriptive names over abbreviations (Clean Code). Functions are verbs; variables are nouns.
- Use strict typing; annotate public APIs and exported functions.
- Avoid deep nesting; use early returns and guard clauses.
- Handle errors and edge cases explicitly; surface helpful messages.

# Comments

- Keep comments minimal; explain non-obvious intent, not the obvious mechanics.
- Avoid TODOsâ€”implement or ticket them.

# Formatting

- Match existing formatting; avoid reformatting unrelated code in edits.
- Prefer multi-line constructs for readability; wrap long lines.
