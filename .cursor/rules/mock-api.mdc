# Mock API Server

- Location: `services/mock-api` (separate from production apps).
- Purpose: serve mock responses based on [docs/API/openapi.yaml](mdc:docs/API/openapi.yaml) for frontend development.

# Suggested Setup (Prism)

`services/mock-api/package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "prism mock ../../docs/API/openapi.yaml -p 4010 --cors --errors"
  },
  "devDependencies": { "@stoplight/prism-cli": "^5.10.1" }
}
```

Run locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter @sms/mock-api dev
```

Point the frontend to `http://localhost:4010` via env (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`).

Do not deploy this service.
