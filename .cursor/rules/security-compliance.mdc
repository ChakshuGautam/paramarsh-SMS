# Security & Compliance Rules

- Enforce least-privilege RBAC/ABAC; sensitive modules require explicit checks
- PII segregation and data minimization; audit access to student/staff records
- Use signed webhooks; validate request signatures and replay protection
- Apply rate limits for public endpoints and per-tenant quotas
- Follow checklists: `[Security](mdc:docs-cursor/checklists/security.md)`, `[Privacy](mdc:docs-cursor/checklists/privacy.md)`
