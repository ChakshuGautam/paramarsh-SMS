## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PARAMARSH_API_BASE` | SMS API base URL | `http://localhost:3001/api/admin` |
| `PARAMARSH_DEFAULT_BRANCH` | Default branch ID | `dps-main` |
| `PARAMARSH_AUTH_TOKEN` | Clerk JWT token | Required |
| `PARAMARSH_SCHOOL_ID` | School identifier | `dps` |

### Getting Your Auth Token

1. Open your SMS admin panel in browser
2. Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Make any API request
4. Copy the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header value
5. Add to your `.env` file

## Query Mapping Logic

The MCP server maps natural language queries to specific API endpoints:

- **Keywords Detection** - Identifies intent from words like "overdue", "active", "today"
- **Parameter Extraction** - Pulls out class names, amounts, dates from queries  
- **Filter Building** - Constructs appropriate API filters and parameters
- **Multi-Call Support** - Can combine multiple API calls for comprehensive answers

## API Endpoints Used

- `/students` - Student data and enrollment information
- `/teachers` - Teacher profiles and assignments  
- `/attendance` - Attendance records and statistics
- `/invoices` - Invoice and billing information
- `/payments` - Payment records and transactions
- `/comms/messages` - SMS, email, and notification logs
- `/campaigns` - Communication campaign data
- `/tickets` - Support tickets and helpdesk

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify `PARAMARSH_API_BASE` is correct and accessible
- Check that your auth token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the SMS backend is running

**Authentication Errors:**  
- Refresh your auth token from the browser
- Verify the token includes proper branch permissions
- Check that the branch ID exists in your system

**No Results:**
- Try broader queries first ("students", "teachers")  
- Check if data exists for your branch in the admin panel
- Verify branch ID spelling and format
