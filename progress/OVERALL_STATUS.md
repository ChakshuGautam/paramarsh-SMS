## 🚦 Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Timetable Complexity** - Algorithm implementation challenging
2. **Payment Integration** - Security and compliance requirements
3. **Performance** - No optimization done yet
4. **Data Migration** - No strategy for existing school data

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Consider third-party timetable library
2. Use established payment gateway SDK
3. Implement caching and indexing
4. Create migration tools and scripts

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Hire Developers** - Need 4-6 more developers urgently
2. **Prioritize MVP** - Focus on core modules first
3. **Setup Testing** - Implement test framework immediately
4. **Backend RBAC** - Security critical, implement now

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Buy vs Build** - Consider third-party solutions for complex modules
2. **Phased Rollout** - Launch with MVP, iterate based on feedback
3. **Cloud vs On-premise** - Decide deployment strategy
4. **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Finalize approach

## 📞 Support & Documentation

### Available Documentation

## Summary

The Paramarsh SMS project is **35% complete** with strong foundations in place (database, basic CRUD, RBAC, communications). However, critical business features (timetable, complete fees, payroll) are missing. The project needs additional developers and 8-10 weeks of focused development to reach MVP status.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Additional developer resources
2. Focus on critical features first
3. Implement backend security
4. Set up proper testing
5. Create production infrastructure

**Current State**: Development/Prototype
**Target State**: Production-ready SaaS
**Gap**: 65% features, security, testing, infrastructure
