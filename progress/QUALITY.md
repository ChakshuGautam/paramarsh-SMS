# Quality Assessment (Subjective — Auto-drafted)

This is a first-pass subjective narrative based on signals and repository structure. Please edit as needed.

## Strengths
- OpenAPI spec present; endpoints and schemas defined.
- Response conventions documented (pagination, errors).
- Backend includes Problem+JSON handler components.
- Tenancy/branch guard present — indicates multi-tenant scoping.
- Health module present for basic observability.
- Test scaffolding exists (backend and/or web).
- Mock API service available for FE dev.
- Admin uses reference components for relations.
- Admin resources are structured consistently across modules.

## Gaps / Risks
- Communications module implementation may be partial (heuristic uses files module as proxy).
- Timetable domain lacks explicit backend module; only UI-side section/class resources mapped.
- Analytics and several modules are documentation-only with no backend/frontend implementation yet.
- Observability beyond healthcheck (structured logging, tracing, metrics) not detected.

## Recommendations
- Add explicit timetable backend module and align OpenAPI paths.
- Implement communications (templates, campaigns, messages) server module per spec.
- Expand Problem+JSON and RFC7807 coverage uniformly; include correlation ids.
- Add tests per module and coverage tracking; include Cypress for admin flows.
- Add structured logging and tracing; expose /metrics for Prometheus if applicable.
- Track module maturity in this report (e.g., Draft/In Progress/Ready).
