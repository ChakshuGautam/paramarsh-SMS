|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | Low | High | Comprehensive backups, rollback plan |
| Performance regression | Medium | Medium | Continuous benchmarking, optimization |
| Breaking changes missed | Medium | High | Extensive testing, gradual rollout |
| Team availability | Low | Medium | Cross-training, documentation |

### Contingency Plans

#### If Behind Schedule
