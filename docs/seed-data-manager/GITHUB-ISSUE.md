# GitHub Issue: Migrate seed-data-manager from v2.0 to v3.0 (Critical: Data Not Persisting)

## üö® Priority: CRITICAL

## Summary
The current seed-data-manager v2.0 is failing to persist any data to the database (0 records for all entities). We need to migrate to a new v3.0 architecture that is Prisma-native, modular, testable, and supports multi-branch/multi-year seeding.

## Current State (v2.0) - BROKEN
- **Health Score**: 15/100 ‚ùå
- **All entity counts**: 0 (seed not persisting data)
- **Architecture**: Monolithic 1,165-line file using MCP PostgreSQL tools
- **Test Coverage**: 0%
- **Observability**: None
- **Recovery**: None

## Target State (v3.0)
- **100% Prisma-native** (no MCP dependencies)
- **Modular architecture** with individual entity seeders
- **90%+ test coverage** with Jest
- **Observable execution** with real-time progress
- **Multi-branch support** for 13 composite branches
- **Historical data** generation (1-5 years)

## Problem Statement

### Critical Issues
1. **Data Not Persisting**: Validation report shows 0 records for all entities
2. **MCP Dependency**: Tightly coupled to MCP PostgreSQL tools
3. **Monolithic Design**: Single 1,165-line file impossible to maintain
4. **No Testing**: 0% test coverage, changes break silently
5. **No Observability**: Black-box execution, can't debug failures
6. **No Recovery**: Must restart from beginning on any failure

### Business Impact
- Cannot demo the system (no data)
- Cannot test features (no seed data)
- Development blocked without reliable test data
- Multi-tenant features cannot be validated

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture Changes
```
FROM: apps/api/prisma/seed.ts (monolithic)
TO:   apps/api/src/seed/ (modular)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Framework
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seeders/        # Entity seeders
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generators/     # Data generators
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/      # Comprehensive tests
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Prisma-Native Operations**
   ```typescript
   // Before (v2.0)
   await mcp__postgresql__create_record({...})
   
   // After (v3.0)
   await prisma.student.createMany({...})
   ```

2. **Modular Seeders**
   ```typescript
   class StudentSeeder extends PrismaSeeder {
     generate(): StudentCreateInput[]
     seed(): Promise<SeedResult>
     validate(): Promise<ValidationResult>
   }
   ```

3. **Observable Execution**
   ```typescript
   orchestrator.on('progress', (data) => {
     console.log(`${data.entity}: ${data.percentage}%`)
   })
   ```

4. **Multi-Branch Support**
   ```typescript
   await multiBranch.seedAllBranches({
     branches: 13,
     yearsOfHistory: 3,
     parallel: true
   })
   ```

## Implementation Plan

### Timeline: 4 Weeks

#### Week 1: Foundation (Jan 27-31)
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement core framework
- [ ] Create base seeder classes
- [ ] Build orchestrator

#### Week 2: Migration (Feb 3-7)
- [ ] Migrate entity seeders
- [ ] Implement generators
- [ ] Add multi-branch support
- [ ] Create validators

#### Week 3: Testing (Feb 10-14)
- [ ] Unit tests (90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Bug fixes

#### Week 4: Deployment (Feb 17-21)
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Training
- [ ] Staging deployment
- [ ] Production rollout

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All 13 branches seed successfully
- [ ] Minimum 500 students per branch created
- [ ] All relationships properly established
- [ ] Indian context data (names, addresses, phone numbers)
- [ ] Multi-year historical data generated

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] 100% Prisma-native (no MCP tools)
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] < 3 minutes to seed all branches
- [ ] < 512MB memory usage
- [ ] Full transaction support
- [ ] Checkpoint/recovery system

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Zero data integrity issues

## Breaking Changes

### Major Changes
1. **Database Operations**: MCP tools ‚Üí Prisma Client
2. **File Location**: `prisma/seed.ts` ‚Üí `src/seed/`
3. **CLI Commands**: New parameter-based commands
4. **Configuration**: External config files
5. **Error Handling**: Event-based system

### Migration Required
- Update all npm scripts
- Retrain team on new CLI
- Update CI/CD pipelines
- Backup existing data

## Resources Required

### Team
- Technical Lead (1)
- Backend Developers (2)
- QA Engineer (1)

## Comments

### Initial Analysis
The current v2.0 seed-data-manager is completely broken - validation reports show 0 records for all entities. This is blocking development and testing. The proposed v3.0 architecture addresses all critical issues while adding essential features like multi-branch support and historical data generation.

### Next Steps
1. Team kickoff meeting scheduled for Jan 27
2. Development environment setup
3. Begin Week 1 implementation
