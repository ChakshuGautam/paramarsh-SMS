## Deployment
- Containerized microservices behind an API Gateway and WAF; per-tenant schema sharding.
- Managed Postgres cluster; Redis for cache/queues; S3-compatible object storage.
- Observability: logs, metrics, traces via centralized stack.

## Security
- Zero trust between services with mTLS; secrets in vault; short-lived tokens; least privilege.

## Data Ownership & Residency
- Tenant isolation enforced at DB and application layers; regional deployments for EU/India.
