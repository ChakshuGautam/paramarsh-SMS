# Docs (Cursor) for Paramarsh SMS

This folder contains product documentation authored for Cursor. The centerpiece is a deep, end-to-end PRD for a modern School Management System (SMS) covering requirements, personas, workflows, data model, APIs, security, compliance, analytics, and delivery.

- Start with `prd.md` for the full Product Requirements Document.
- Use the Table of Contents in `prd.md` to jump to specific areas (e.g., fees, attendance, exams, HR/payroll, analytics).

Contributing:
- Keep edits atomic and clearly labeled in pull requests.
- Maintain consistency with roles, naming, and data entities defined in `prd.md`.
- If adding new modules, update the Table of Contents and the dependency map.
